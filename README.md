Embedded Operating System - Activity 6

Implement the following scheduling algorithms using Arduino or TinkerCAD. 

An LED represents the process or task.

Number of LEDs (Minimum): 6
Time for LEDs: Up to you as long as the algorithm works.

First In First Out
Shortest Job First
Round Robin

Example (First In First Out).

LED 1 - 10s
LED 2 - 5s
LED 3 - 8s
LED 4 - 3s
LED 5 - 1s
LED 6 - 2s

LED 1 lights up for 10s, LED 2 for 5s, LED 3 for 8s and so on.
